# Water_Bodies_EDA_ACEA
Analysis about various water bodies under ACEA
# Objective
Preserve the waterbodies (Lake, Aquifier, Water Spring, River) for efficient water supply management. To achieve this,it is important to predict the most efficient water availability, in terms of level and water flow for each day of the year.
# Dataset features provided
The features provided are Rain fall, Temperature, Lake level, Flow Rate

# Output expected 
Predicted Lake Level and Flow rate.

# Tentative Analysis approach
1) Plot unfiltered data to see trend->Check the Corelation->Use ML Models to predict flow & Level of lake -> fine tune the model to improve the accuracy.

2) Plot unfiltered data to see trend->Check the Corelation->Use features to build a mathematical model to predict flow & Level of lake -> fine tune the model to improve the accuracy

# Observation about Rain data:
The above plot shows Mangona recieves the maximum rain and S_Piero recieves the minimum over the months in a year. July to August period is the relatively dry period where there is consistent minimum rain. September to February is the time when its raining to a decent level.

# Obseravtion about Temperature data:
Temperature gradually increases from January and reches to peak during June to August and gradually decreases to minimum in January.
